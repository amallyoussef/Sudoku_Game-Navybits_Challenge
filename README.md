Sudoku Game

A fully interactive Sudoku game built using React and TypeScript. This project allows users to play Sudoku with difficulty levels, provides hints, and solves puzzles, showcasing a user-friendly interface and logical functionality.

Challenges Faced

This project marks my first experience using React and TypeScript, which came with a few challenges, such as managing states in react, implementing and debugging the Sudoku solving logic and validation functions.

Solutions Implemented

Several components were built for a cleaner code.
The solver and validation logic were tested extensively to ensure accuracy.
